We're a local chapter of [Classical Conversations](https://classicalconversations.com/) that is dedicated to serving families in the rural counties west of Richmond, VA.

## Why Classical Conversations?

- **A Proven Approach**: The classical curriculum is designed to foster critical thinking, effective communication, and a lifelong love of learning.
- **A Supportive Community**: Classical Conversations of Powhatan strives to be a warm and encouraging community for both parents and children.
- **A Flexible Format**: You are your child's teacher so you can customize your homeschooling experience to fit your family's needs.
- **Christian**: We provide community and educational opportunities in line with Christian faith and values. We also actively learn Scripture together each year. 

We believe in the power of a classical, Christian education to nurture rooted and well-rounded individuals who aren't easily swayed by whatever cultural trend is currently in vogue.

Whether you're a seasoned homeschooler or just starting out, we're here to help. Let's work together to provide your child with a truly exceptional education.
